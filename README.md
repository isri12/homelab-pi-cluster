## 🚀 Project Overview

This project automates the deployment of a lightweight Kubernetes cluster optimized for ARM hardware. It transforms a set of Raspberry Pis into a production-ready home lab capable of running essential self-hosted services.

### Key Features
*   **Automated Deployment**: Full cluster setup using Ansible playbooks.
*   **Lightweight Kubernetes**: Uses K3s for low resource consumption.
*   **GitOps Ready**: Infrastructure defined as code.
*   **Shared Storage**: NFS provisioning for persistent data.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Hardware

*   **Master Node**: Raspberry Pi 4 (4GB RAM) - Runs Control Plane & API Server.
*   **Worker Nodes**: 2x Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ - Runs Application Workloads.
*   **Storage**: USB Drive via NFS (Future: Pi 5 NAS).

*   **N8n**: Workflow automation.
*   **Monitoring Stack**: Grafana & Prometheus for cluster metrics.

## ⚡ Quick Start Summary

1.  **Flash OS**: Install Ubuntu Server (Master) and Raspberry Pi OS Lite (Workers).
2.  **Configure**: Update `ansible/inventory/hosts.yml` with your IPs.
3.  **Deploy**: Run the automated setup script:
    ```bash
    ./scripts/setup-cluster.sh
    ```
